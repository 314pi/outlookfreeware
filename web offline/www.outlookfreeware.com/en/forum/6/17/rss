The Default option is deleting to the Deleted Items without Preserving folder structure. In the <!--noindex--><a href="https://www.reliefjet.com/Essentials/Features/OutlookFolderDeleteEmpty" rel="nofollow">Advanced version</a><!--/noindex--> you can select the folder where to delete folders or delete them permanently.<br />
The utility show names of deleted folders. It is possible to save the list in the Advanced version.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ok, I found my answer to my original post.<br />
<br />
Now I just need an answer to the 'one more question' post.  When I ran the utility, I was not given the option to delete permanently.  But that appears to be the default as none of the deleted empty folders appear in my deleted items folder.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[One more question.<br />
<br />
Is the option to select whether to permanently delete or not available in the freeware version or just the paid version?<br />

      <description><![CDATA[So I missed the message on the download page that said &quot;OutlookFreeware Utility Manager is required to install and run this utility.&quot;  I downloaded and installed Delete Empty Folders.  It installed as an Outlook add-in only. I started to run it, selected the configure option, but it did not allow me to select or to deselect permanent deletion or send to deleted items.<br />
<br />
1.  What is the default selection in the add-in?<br />
2.  I started running this utility knowing I have a large # of empty folders, but freaked out a little at the long list being 'removed', so I stopped the process.  I started to spot check the folders removed and it seemed to be working as intended.<br />
3.  I closed the utility, but then realized nothing was in my deleted items folder.<br />
<br />
Is there a log file or is there anyway to get a list of the folders deleted?<br />
<br />
I just want to be sure to have a record should a problem arise down the road.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help or insight anyone can give.<br />
<br />
