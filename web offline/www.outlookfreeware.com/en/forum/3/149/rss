      <description><![CDATA[<b>Jackie</b>, unfortunately this is not possible. This is because &quot;File As&quot; is an Outlook contact's property. And address picker works with any registered address book. Many of them do not provide &quot;File As&quot; property.]]></description>

<b>Jackie</b>, basically you just start typing your contact's email or name right in to the text box next to the &quot;To...&quot; button and Outlook will suggest you the appropriate contact. This is the most common way to increase your productivity while selecting recipients.</td></tr></table>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I need some help in changing the order of the popup box choices I am given when sending a new email and i want to send it to one of my contacts using the To: choices.<br />
the contact I send to most frequently is way down in the middle of the pack. I have it listed as #1 and the email address is info1.... yet, as you can see the info is an &quot;I&quot; so down in the middle someplace. <br />
How can I set up this contact choice so that the &quot;FILE AS&quot; column is the sorted column and comes up first?<br />
I can't seem to get it changed from &quot;NAME&quot; as the first and sorted column!!!! UGH.<br />
thanks for any help anyone can suggest.<br />
This is in Outlook 2010 so hopefully someone using this program will be able to go to the new email/and choose the To: to see what I am talking about.<br />
thanks again....]]></description>
