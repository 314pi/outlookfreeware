      <description><![CDATA[<b>John Barker,</b><br />
<br />
a) It happens some times. One of the reason that the PST file is corrupt. You can try to fix it using ScanPST utility and then to compact again.<br />
b) Compacting a database is a complicate task. The more mails you have deleted then longer compressing will be. It is recommended to compact more often.<br />
c) Generally, compacting should transfer less data. But creating a new data file and copy there the information is better sometimes. But this method is not always useful. As you need to detach an old storage and attach a new one. You will need to re-create Outlook rules which work with the store and export/import Master Category List as it stored in the storage, etc.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Every December I archive the year's emails for all the users at one of my clients.<br />
<br />
After using the Archive utility, I use Compact Now to reclaim the space freed up by the archiving procedure. However, I have found that, apart from taking several hours to run on large (&gt;5GB) PST files, it doesn't always reduce the file size as much as it should.<br />
<br />
This year I found one user's data was particularly troublesome. The PST file size before archiving and compacting was about 4.5GB - after processing, it came down to 2.7GB.  However, if I run a Folder Size query from the folder properties dialogue, it shows the total contents of the folder as a few hundred KB.  The first compacting operation took about two hours. I repeated the operation, which completed in a few seconds and made no difference to the file size.  I then Exported the entire contents of the compacted folder to a new PST.  This took a few minutes and the resulting file size was a few MB - exactly what I would have expected after archiving.<br />
<br />
I'm now wondering:<br />
a) Why the Compact Now process doesn't always seem to work as expected<br />
b) Why it takes so long<br />
and<br />
c) Is Exporting the datafile contents to a new PST (which takes a fraction of the time it takes to compact) a valid substitute for compaction?]]></description>
