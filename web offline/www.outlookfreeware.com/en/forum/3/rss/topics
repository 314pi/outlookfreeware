I use OutlookFreeware v4.3.0<br />

When I choose &quot;Export Messages to EML files&quot;, tool say &quot;It is possible to retain the original folder structure&quot;.<br />
<br />
When I export messages, all files are put at the root of the &quot;folder for messages in .EML format&quot; and the folder structure is lost.<br />

Is there a way to configure sub-folder creation to keep original structure ?<br />

      <title><![CDATA[Compacting PST files]]></title>
      <link>https://www.outlookfreeware.com/en/forum/3/207</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Every December I archive the year's emails for all the users at one of my clients.<br />
<br />
After using the Archive utility, I use Compact Now to reclaim the space freed up by the archiving procedure. However, I have found that, apart from taking several hours to run on large (&gt;5GB) PST files, it doesn't always reduce the file size as much as it should.<br />
<br />
This year I found one user's data was particularly troublesome. The PST file size before archiving and compacting was about 4.5GB - after processing, it came down to 2.7GB.  However, if I run a Folder Size query from the folder properties dialogue, it shows the total contents of the folder as a few hundred KB.  The first compacting operation took about two hours. I repeated the operation, which completed in a few seconds and made no difference to the file size.  I then Exported the entire contents of the compacted folder to a new PST.  This took a few minutes and the resulting file size was a few MB - exactly what I would have expected after archiving.<br />
<br />
I'm now wondering:<br />
a) Why the Compact Now process doesn't always seem to work as expected<br />
b) Why it takes so long<br />
and<br />
c) Is Exporting the datafile contents to a new PST (which takes a fraction of the time it takes to compact) a valid substitute for compaction?]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Backward compatibility of utilities]]></title>
      <link>https://www.outlookfreeware.com/en/forum/3/192</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I’ll tell you what I did and how I got shocked. <br />
<br />
I had seamlessly working runtime and ca 30 utilities downloaded on Jan. 19, 2014. Today I visited your site and found some new really useful utilities which I downloaded and tried to install. The soft informed that runtime update is needed. So I downloaded an updated version of your runtime setup, installed (i.e. the soft quite logically required unistallation of the previous version and then could be installed). Then I installed newly downloaded utilities. Installation went fine. And then? Whenever I open your software whether as Outlook addin, or in a standalone version, I find that actually all utilities from January this year are outdated and cannot be used. My version of Outlook (2003) and system environment have not changed since the first download. <br />
Three big questions: <br />
1) is it really true that your runtime update is not backward compatible with the previous version so that utilities using the previous version get inoperable under the runtime in a new version? <br />
2) do I really need to re-download all my 30 utilities downloaded only 6 months ago??? If so, it’s really disappointing because I am used to qualified software which is mostly backward compatible when used in the same environment, except exceptionally important updates. Downloading and installing some 30 utilities is a time-consuming operation and I cherish my time;<br />
3) is there a workaround of the issue, that could save time of mine and of other users? <br />
<br />
Your assistance will be really appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
