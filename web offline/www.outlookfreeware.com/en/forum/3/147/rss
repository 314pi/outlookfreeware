      <description><![CDATA[I'm not looking to block certain attachments, I'm looking to block all attachments from being opened, and only allowing people to save the documents. As in, be prompted to save it when they have an attachment. This should prevent people opening the file and having a copy in the users temporary files, that they may work on when the file should be saved in their My Documents folder, or other, to work on.<br />
<br />
Or, do you mean that by installing and configuring the attachments tool, i can block docx files etc, from being opened and they only have the option to save them?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<b>Alex</b>, you can easily achieve this by installing our <!--noindex--><a href="/en/products/all/OutlookAttachmentsSave/" rel="nofollow">Save Attachments</a><!--/noindex--> tool and configuring it as a favorite in message context menu and on message window toolbar/ribbon. After that just block access to attachments of desired types (.docx, *.xlsx, and others).]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I'm wondering if any of the Attachment processing 'Save Attachments' plugins can disable or hide the option to open attachments, and just give the user the save option?<br />
<br />
Far too many people are opening documents, editing it and saving it in a temp file and not using it on a saved document in their own drive/folders.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.]]></description>
