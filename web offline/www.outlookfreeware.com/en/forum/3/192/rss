We have re-write our internal engine in 3.0.0 version. This cause incompatibility of a new runtime with old utilities. But this also allow to us to create a &quot;some new really useful utilities&quot; and also improve stability and performance of old utilities.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to re-download 30 utilities then you can use our commercial product <!--noindex--><a href="http://www.reliefjet.com/" rel="nofollow">ReliefJet Essentials for Outlook</a><!--/noindex-->. It has a single download file and include all OutlookFreeware utilities with Advanced versions and few additional utilities.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I’ll tell you what I did and how I got shocked. <br />
<br />
I had seamlessly working runtime and ca 30 utilities downloaded on Jan. 19, 2014. Today I visited your site and found some new really useful utilities which I downloaded and tried to install. The soft informed that runtime update is needed. So I downloaded an updated version of your runtime setup, installed (i.e. the soft quite logically required unistallation of the previous version and then could be installed). Then I installed newly downloaded utilities. Installation went fine. And then? Whenever I open your software whether as Outlook addin, or in a standalone version, I find that actually all utilities from January this year are outdated and cannot be used. My version of Outlook (2003) and system environment have not changed since the first download. <br />
Three big questions: <br />
1) is it really true that your runtime update is not backward compatible with the previous version so that utilities using the previous version get inoperable under the runtime in a new version? <br />
2) do I really need to re-download all my 30 utilities downloaded only 6 months ago??? If so, it’s really disappointing because I am used to qualified software which is mostly backward compatible when used in the same environment, except exceptionally important updates. Downloading and installing some 30 utilities is a time-consuming operation and I cherish my time;<br />
3) is there a workaround of the issue, that could save time of mine and of other users? <br />
<br />
Your assistance will be really appreciated.<br />
